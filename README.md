# Java-SpringBoot-Workshop
A project I developed in a workshop organized by Archi's Academy.

This project uses the Java language and SpringBoot framework to run the Chat-GPT integration on our local host.

To use the project,
> You need to create a Key from "https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys". 
> Write this key in the relevant field in the "application.properties" file.
> Then run the project.
> Open the Postman application.
> Type http://localhost:8081/chat/prompt (if you are running on port 8081) and select the POST method.
> Select the body section and select the raw section and then you can type the message you want.
